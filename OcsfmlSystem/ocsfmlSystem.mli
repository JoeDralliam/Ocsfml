  (** Represents a time value 
      Time.t encapsulates a time value in a flexible way.
      
      It allows to define a time value either as a number of seconds,
      milliseconds or microseconds. It also works the other way round:
      you can read a time value as either a number of seconds,
      milliseconds or microseconds.
      
      By using such a flexible interface, the API doesn't impose any
      fixed type or resolution for time values, and let the user
      choose its own favorite representation.
      
      Time values support the usual mathematical operations: you can
      add or subtract two times, multiply or divide a time by a
      number, compare two times, etc.
      
      Since they represent a time span and not an absolute time value,
      times can also be negative.
      
      Usage example:
      {[
      let t1 = Time.seconds 0.1 in
      let milli = Time.as_milliseconds t1 in // 100
      
      let t2 = Time.milliseconds 30  in
      let micro = Time.as_microseconds t2 in // 30000
      
      let t3 = Time.microseconds -800000L in
      let sec = Time.as_seconds t3 in // -0.8
      
      let update elapsed =
      position := position +. speed *. (Time.as_seconds elapsed)
      
      update (Time.milliseconds 100)
      ]}

(** Utility class that measures the elapsed time. 
      clock is a lightweight class for measuring time.
    
    Its provides the most precise time that the underlying OS can
    achieve (generally microseconds or nanoseconds). It also ensures
    monotonicity, which means that the returned time can never go
    backward, even if the system time is changed.
    
    Usage example:
    {[
    let clock;= new clock in
    ...
    let time1 = clock#get_elapsed_time in
    ...
    let time2 = clock#restart in
    ]} 
    The time value returned by the clock can then be converted to a
    number of seconds, milliseconds or even microseconds. *)
